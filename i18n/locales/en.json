        "part_1": "Like for most people, archery was something that began in my childhood. Later, when I had my own kids, the bow I used as a child was started to be used by my son. After a while, I got us “real” bows to shoot with, and we started attending competitions. My daughter also joined us and slowly I began making us our own arrows, quivers, belts, hats and boots.",
        "part_2": "In October 2006 I opened my own archery shop called Csodaszarvas íjászbarlang in Villányi Street. I’ve always wanted to teach, so I became an accredited archery teacher too. Then we had the opportunity to move to a better location, to the other side of Móricz Zsigmond square, where we could open a shooting range along with the shop. Me and my archer friends founded an archery association called Csodaszarvas Sportegyesület. With the new shooting range, everybody was able to practice now, whether it was raining outside or not. And let’s not forget that we could finally start teaching important things - like archery - and “re-educate” the children who came in, teaching them to value traditions and our history, without an age limit.",

      "now": {
        "part_1": "… When I took over the shop from my father, my goal was to help it develop. Now the shooting range isn’t only open to traditional archers, but also to Olympic archers. Our olympic durafoam targets and the 18-21 metres long shooting ranges make the shooting suitable for them as well. Anyone who needs to prepare for competitions has a place here. Our targets are moveable. ",
        "part_2": "We also believe that craftman entrepreneurs’ bows are being made with more care and skill than manufactured ones, so you can only find craftsman's work in our shop. This is also how we try to support these small businesses. Our company also began to sell hand-made products, bows and arrows that are our own brand, mostly made by my father. We’ve put more than 15 years of experience into our bow’s design and implementation. Our archery association now has an Olympic-archery group too. Many traditional archers decided to try themselves out due to our new, adequate shooting range, which gives an opportunity to train during the season. In the future we’re planning on opening an outdoor shooting range too.",
